Hi! I'm passionate about solving challenging problems to create definite, broad, and positive impacts on
people. Currently, I'm focused on robotics, machine learning, and machine perception as I believe 
that these technologies have the potential to address scarcity. Time, energy, sustainability,
productivity, housing, healthcare, food and self-determination are all in constant demand. While I 
believe people must collaborate to solve our fundamental challenges, I'm hopeful that robots
will play a vital role in supporting us along the way.

My research interests lie in creating general embodied agents that can reason, learn, and act in 
the world they perceive. I've worked at the [Boston Dynamics AI Institute](https://theaiinstitute.com/),
 [Amazon Robotics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/amazon-fulfillment-technologies-robotics/p),
[General Electric Research](https://www.linkedin.com/company/geresearch/),
 and the [Robotics & Intelligent Vehicles Research Lab](https://robot.neu.edu/)@[Northeastern](https://robotics.northeastern.edu/).

A note on my personal ethics, which have evolved over time: I will not work on certain applications of technology such as war, violence, weaponry,
subjugation, discrimination, surveillance, policing, "deterrents", and "defense", or for "defense" companies. I 
 am a proponent of [Stop Killer Robots](https://www.stopkillerrobots.org/) and I agree
 with many of the ideologies in [Prof. Ben Kuiper's article](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~kuipers/opinions/no-military-funding.html). 
 <strong> If you are interested in my work, I humbly request that you use my efforts constructively, and not corrupt my work for harm.
