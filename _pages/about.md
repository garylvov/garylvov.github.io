Hi! I'm passionate about solving challenging problems to create a definite, positive impact on people's lives. 
Currently, I'm focused on robotics, machine learning, and machine perception as I believe 
that these technologies have the potential to help address scarcity. While I 
believe people must collaborate to solve our fundamental challenges, I'm hopeful that robots
will play a vital role in supporting us along the way.

My research interests lie in creating general embodied agents that can reason, learn, and act in 
the world they perceive to help people complete tasks. I've worked at the [Robotics and AI Institute](https://rai-inst.com/),
 [Amazon Robotics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/amazon-fulfillment-technologies-robotics/p),
 the Robotics & Autonomous Systems Lab@[General Electric Research](https://www.linkedin.com/company/geresearch/),
 and the [Robotics & Intelligent Vehicles Research Lab](https://robot.neu.edu/)@[Northeastern University](https://robotics.northeastern.edu/).

I'm graduating from Northeastern University in May 2025 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering and Computer Science.
