Hi! I'm passionate about solving challenging problems to create a definite and positive impact on people's lives. 
My current research interests lie in creating general robots that can reason, learn, and act in 
the world they perceive to help people. I'm especially interested in teaching robots to do complex stuff with their hands based on what they see and feel.

I'm a PhD student advised by Prof. [Stefanie Tellex](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanie-tellex-38468818/) in the [Humans to Robots Lab](https://h2r.cs.brown.edu/) at Brown University.

I've worked at the [Robotics & AI Institute (formerly Boston Dynamics AI Institute)](https://rai-inst.com/),
 [Amazon Robotics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/amazon-fulfillment-technologies-robotics/p), and
 the Robotics & Autonomous Systems Lab@[General Electric Research](https://www.linkedin.com/company/geresearch/).

I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering and Computer Science from Northeastern University, where I was advised by Prof. [Taskin Padir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tpadir/)
in the [Robotics & Intelligent Vehicles Research Lab](https://robot.neu.edu/).
